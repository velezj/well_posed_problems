A first statment

[[ and now a block statemnt ]]

These are just
a Set of
Statements

%%
import numpy as np

def foo( a ):
    return a + 1

for x in World:
    assert( foo( x ) == 2 )
%%

And back to statements

%end with some arguments [[ that are blocked ]] %

And some more statements

[[ and some fancy [[ double blocked ]] statements [[ with pleasure ]] ]]

and some more stuff
