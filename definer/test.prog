This is a test statement
With another line in the same statement below

And then a binding below this:

w := 7

And now we have [[ A more compliated form that works ]] for a bit
;;

So le'ts try [[ a more
spatially varied statement ]] with some
jaxz

%%python%
We are in a context here
%%%

And some more statements

Let's start with some commands
\enter A very interesting thing here ;;

e := "A string here"

WorldNode := #|Node=399289|#

The_World := the world to test

%%python%
import numpy as np
np.log( e )
%%%

\leave that thing

A_World := A [[ Simple World ]] which must be [[ tested well ]] ;;

And finish
